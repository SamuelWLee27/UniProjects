					<h2>Basics of a HTTP request</h2>
					<p>A HTTP request is made by a client, to a named host, which is located on a server. The goal is to access a resource on a server for example a web page.</p>
					<p>A HTTP request is composed of three elements:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>A request line.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>A request of specific headers.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>An optional request body.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<!-- explains request line with bullet points and an image -->
				<div>
					<h2>Request line</h2>
					<p>The request line consists of three things:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									The HTTP method (the operation we want to carry out on the resource). The method is a one word command that tells
									the server what it should do with the resource requested. 
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>The path and filename of the resource being requested.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>The version of HTTP to use.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>An example of this is below.</p>

					<h2>HTTP request headers</h2>
					<p>Request specific headers add information to the request or configure aspects of the request. Example below.</p>

				</div>
				<!-- explains request body -->
				<div>
					<h2>HTTP request body</h2>
					<p>Sometimes the request body plus the header request do not always contain all the information needed. This is when a request body comes into play. As request bodies are only appropriate for some request methods. For example, a POST method where the body of the request message is a string representing the data entered by the user. Where as the GET method, which asks the server to send a recource, does not have a request body</p>

					<h2>Common error codes</h2>
					<p>There are two status code categories that when recieved in a response message means an error has occured. These are client errors (4xx: bad request syntax, can't be fulfilled) and server errors (5xx: request seende valid but could not fulfill it). Some common client and server errors are in the table below</p>
					<table>
						<caption>Common errors</caption>
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Code</th><th>Error</th><th>Discription</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>403</td><td>Forbidden</td><td>The request was legal but the server refuses to erspond (e.g. Don't have sufficient permission).</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>404</td><td>Not Found</td><td>The server can't find the requested resource (e.g. The path and filename do not resolve to a locatable file).</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>500</td><td>Internal Server Error</td><td>The server failed when processinnf the request but not further details are avalible</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>505</td><td>HTTP Version Not Supported</td><td>The server does not support the version of HTTP given in the request line.</td>
							</tr>
