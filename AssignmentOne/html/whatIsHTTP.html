					<h2>HTTP</h2>
					<!-- span tags used to highlight words being explained -->
					<p>HTTP is an abbreviation for hypertext transfer protocol. HTTP is used to define how <span style="color: rgb(255, 174, 0);">entities</span> dealing with the movement of <span style="color: rgb(255, 174, 0);">hypertext</span> 
						documents on <span style="color: rgb(255, 174, 0);">the network</span> should communicate with each other.</p>

						<!-- bulleted list explaining highlighted words -->
					<ul>
						<li>Entities are web browsers and web servers (software applications).</li>
						<li>HyperText documents are web pages and the resources they use</li>
						<li>The network is the local network or something broader or worldwide</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Basically HTTP is the main method used to transfer data from web pages over a network. Servers store web pages, which are then accessed by the
						user making a client request by searching something. Without HTTP, the world wide web (www) would not exist. As it is created from server client connections forming a network.</p>

					<p>A big issue with HTTP is that data over a HTTP connection is not encrypted, so it runs the risk of third-party interference from attackers trying to steal information. As information over a network using HTTP is not private, sensitive information like credit card data is vulnerable if submitted on a HTTP page.</p>
					
					<h3>How it works</h3>
					<p>A request message describing what the client is trying to retrieve is sent by the browser to the server. Then a response message is sent by the server to the browser describing how it coped
						with the request, along with the requested resource if available. This all takes place in a manner of milliseconds. So, for example you search www.cms.waikato.ac.nz. The request for this web page is sent to the server. Then the server sends a response back with the result of the request. Then the results are displayed by the client to the user.</p>

					<h2>How does HTTPS work?</h2>
					<p>HTTPS stands for hyper transfer protocol secure. Unlike HTTP, HTTPS is encrypted. HTTPS uses SSL (secure sockets layer) which is able to secure a connection and verify that the site is legitimate. SSL creates a secure, encrypted connection between browser and a server, that is able to protect the layer of communication between the two.</p>
					<p>HTTPS is important because it adds a layer of protection to prevent third-party attackers from getting important sensitive data. This is extremely important for websites that involve transactions or when your users need to enter their real information.</p>

					<h2>Different versions of HTTP</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h3>HTTP v0.9</h3>
							<p>This is the first documented version of HTTP (1991). It has only one method, GET (a web page), and server response is always HTML web page</p>
						</li>	
						<li>
							<h3>HTTPS</h3>
							<p>Also called SSL, HTTPS is the encrypted variant of HTTP to guard against hacker attacks. It was invented in 1995, but was not widely used until recently </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>HTTP v1.1</h3>
							<p>This is the most commonly used HTTP. It has increased security, support for additional methods (e.g. PUT), and different types of responses (e.g. images) </p>
						</li>
