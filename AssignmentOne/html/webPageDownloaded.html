					<h2>What happens when you search for a web page</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<u>User searches a web page in the search bar</u>
							<p>eg. User puts www.cms.waikato.ac.nz in the search bar of a browser.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>Client sends a HTTP request to the server</u>
							<p>Request messages sent using HTTP include a request line followed by request 
								for specific headers and then a optional request body.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>HTTP returns a status code response from the server</u>
							<p>There are 5 categories for a status code:</p> 
							<ul>
								<li>1xx information (request received, continuing) [100,101,102]</li>
								<li>2xx success (action received, understood, accepted) [200,201,204]</li>
								<li>3xx redirection (further action needed) [300,301,307]</li>
								<li>4xx client error (bad request syntax, or can't be fulfilled) [403,404,408]</li>
								<li>5xx server error (request seemed valid but server couldn't fulfill it) [500,502,503]</li>
							</ul>	
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>The client downloads web page data from the server through HTTP</u>
							<p>The server sends what makes up the web page such HTML files, CSS files, images, and other information that makes up a webpage normally in that order.</p>
						</li>

					<h2>What data does the client get from the server</h2>
					<p>Files that are downloaded are all the files that are used to make up the website such as HTML files, CSS files images, so on.</p>

					<p>These files all have different priorities in which order they need to be downloaded. Starting with what's essential for the website, such as HTML files which 
						make up the structure and content of the web page. Next it's stuff like CSS files which is the styling of the pages holding stuff like the fonts, colours, ect. Followed by images. Lastly, everything that 
						isn't really important to the website. The order in which everything is downloaded is shown in the waterfall.</p>

					<p>It is important the priorities are done this way as you need to have the HTML for the content of the website, then the css to style that content,
						then images and stuff come up after that to complete the look of the website.</p>
